Environment variables
The following environment variables control the configuration of the Nextflow runtime and the underlying Java virtual machine.

Java settings

JAVA_CMDDefines the path location of the Java binary command used to launch Nextflow.

JAVA_HOMEDefines the path location of the Java VM installation used to run Nextflow.




Nextflow settings

NXF_ANSI_LOGEnables/disables ANSI console output (default true when ANSI terminal is detected).

NXF_ANSI_SUMMARYEnables/disables ANSI completion summary: true\|false (default: print summary if execution last more than 1 minute).

NXF_ASSETSDefines the directory where downloaded pipeline repositories are stored (default: $NXF_HOME/assets)

NXF_CACHE_DIR
New in version 24.02.0-edge.


Defines the base cache directory when using the default cache store (default: "$launchDir/.nextflow").

NXF_CHARLIECLOUD_CACHEDIRDirectory where remote Charliecloud images are stored. When using a computing cluster it must be a shared folder accessible from all compute nodes.

NXF_CLOUDCACHE_PATH
New in version 23.07.0-edge.


Defines the base cache path when using the cloud cache store.

NXF_CLOUD_DRIVERDefines the default cloud driver to be used if not specified in the config file or as command line option, either aws or google.

NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIRDirectory where Conda environments are stored. When using a computing cluster it must be a shared folder accessible from all compute nodes.

NXF_CONDA_ENABLED
New in version 22.08.0-edge.


Enable the use of Conda recipes defined by using the conda directive. (default: false).

Disables the cancellation of child jobs on workflow execution termination.

NXF_DISABLE_PARAMS_TYPE_DETECTION
New in version 23.07.0-edge.


Disables the automatic type detection of command line parameters.

NXF_DISABLE_WAVE_SERVICE
New in version 23.08.0-edge.


Disables the requirement for Wave service when enabling the Fusion file system.

NXF_ENABLE_AWS_SES
New in version 23.06.0-edge.


Enable to use of AWS SES native API for sending emails in place of legacy SMTP settings (default: false)

NXF_ENABLE_FS_SYNC
New in version 23.10.0.


When enabled the job script will execute Linux sync command on job completion. This may be useful to synchronize the job state over shared file systems (default: false)

NXF_ENABLE_SECRETS
New in version 21.09.0-edge.


Enable Nextflow secrets features (default: true)

NXF_ENABLE_STRICT
New in version 22.05.0-edge.


Enable Nextflow strict execution mode (default: false)

NXF_ENABLE_VIRTUAL_THREADS
New in version 23.05.0-edge.


Enable the use of virtual threads in the Nextflow runtime (default: false)

NXF_EXECUTORDefines the default process executor, e.g. sge

NXF_FILE_ROOT
New in version 23.05.0-edge.


The file storage path against which relative file paths are resolved.

For example, with NXF_FILE_ROOT=/some/root/path, the use of file('foo') will be resolved to the absolute path /some/root/path/foo. A remote root path can be specified using the usual protocol prefix, e.g. NXF_FILE_ROOT=s3://my-bucket/data. Files defined using an absolute path are not affected by this setting.

NXF_HOMENextflow home directory (default: $HOME/.nextflow).

NXF_JAVA_HOMEDefines the path location of the Java VM installation used to run Nextflow. This variable overrides the JAVA_HOME variable if defined.

NXF_JVM_ARGS
New in version 21.12.1-edge.


Allows the setting Java VM options. This is similar to NXF_OPTS however it’s only applied the JVM running Nextflow and not to any java pre-launching commands.

NXF_LOG_FILEThe filename of the Nextflow log (default: .nextflow.log)

NXF_OFFLINEWhen true prevents Nextflow from automatically downloading and updating remote project repositories (default: false).


Changed in version 23.09.0-edge: This option also disables the automatic version check (see NXF_DISABLE_CHECK_LATEST).



Changed in version 23.11.0-edge: This option also prevents plugins from being downloaded. Plugin versions must be specified in offline mode, or else Nextflow will fail.


NXF_OPTSProvides extra options for the Java and Nextflow runtime. It must be a blank separated list of -Dkey[=value] properties.

NXF_ORGDefault organization prefix when looking for a hosted repository (default: nextflow-io).

NXF_PARAMS_FILE
