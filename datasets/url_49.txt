Channel duplication
Problem
You need to you use the same channel as input in two or more processes.
Solution
In DSL2, you can just do it! The into operator is no longer needed.
Code
process foo {
  input: path x
  script: 
  """
  echo your_command --input $x
  """
}    

process bar {
  input: path x
  script: 
  """
  echo your_command --input $x
  """
}    

workflow {
  input_ch = Channel.fromPath("$baseDir/data/prots/*_?.fa")

  foo(input_ch)
  bar(input_ch)
}

Run it
Use the the following command to execute the example:
nextflow run nextflow-io/patterns/channel-duplication.nf
