Ignore failing process
Problem
A task is expected to fail in some cases. You want to ignore the failure and continue the execution of the remaining tasks in the workflow. 
Solution
Use the process directive errorStrategy 'ignore' to ignore the error condition. 
Code
process foo {
  errorStrategy 'ignore'
  script:
  '''
  echo This is going to fail!
  exit 1
  '''
}  

process bar {
  script:
  '''
  echo OK
  '''
}

workflow {
  foo()
  bar()
}

Run it
Run the script with the following command: 
nextflow run nextflow-io/patterns/ignore-failing-process.nf
