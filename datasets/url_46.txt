      GitHub repository         Blogging about Nextflow, computational workflows, containers and cloud computing       My Journey with Nextflow: From Exploration to Automation        Pritam Kumar Panda      25 September 2024     Community Post
     I approach bioinformatics workflows in a whole different way now that I’ve used Nextflow. It has evolved into a vital tool in my toolbox, capable of handling massive genomic datasets and guaranteeing repeatability and scalability. Thanks to Nextflow, I can automate and streamline tasks that used to take days or even weeks, whether it’s merging disparate software applications or simplifying intricate pipelines. To go beyond the constraints of conventional scripting (bash, perl, Python, R) for genomic data analysis was the driving force for my decision to work with Nextflow. Since then, it’s opened up new possibilities, leading me to collaborations, innovation, and now this exciting new role as an Ambassador! I am Pritam Kumar Panda, a bioinformatician working at the German Cancer Research Center DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.    Addressing Bioinformatics Core Challenges with Nextflow and nf-core        Francesco Lescai      11 September 2024     Community Post
     I was honored to be invited to the ISMB 2024 congress to speak at the session organised by the COSI (Community of Special Interest) of Bioinformatics Cores. This session brought together bioinformatics professionals from around the world who manage bioinformatics facilities in different institutions to share experiences, discuss challenges, and explore solutions for managing and analyzing large-scale biological data. In this session, I had the opportunity to introduce Nextflow, and discuss how its adoption can help bioinformatics cores to address some of the most common challenges they face. From managing complex pipelines to optimizing resource utilization, Nextflow offers a range of benefits that can streamline workflows and improve productivity. In this blog, I’ll summarize my talk and share insights on how Nextflow can help overcome some of those challenges, including meeting the needs of a wide range of users or customers, automate reporting, customising pipelines and training.    Moving toward better support through the Community forum        Geraldine Van der Auwera      28 August 2024     As the Nextflow community continues to grow, fostering a space where users can easily find help and share knowledge is more important than ever. In this post, we’ll explore our ongoing efforts to enhance the community forum, transitioning from Slack as the primary platform for peer-to-peer support. By improving the forum’s usability and accessibility, we’re aiming to create a more efficient and welcoming environment for everyone. Read on to learn about the changes we’re implementing and how you can contribute to making the forum an even better resource for the community.    Experimental cleanup with nf-boost         Ben Sherman  and Nicolas Servant     8 August 2024     Community Post
     When I (Ben) was in grad school, I worked on a Nextflow pipeline called GEMmaker, an RNA-seq analysis pipeline similar to nf-core/rnaseq. We quickly ran into a problem, which is that on large runs, we were running out of storage! As it turns out, it wasn’t the final outputs, but the intermediate outputs (the BAM files, etc) that were taking up so much space, and we figured that if we could just delete those intermediate files sooner, we might be able to make it through a pipeline run without running out of storage. We were far from alone.    How I became a Nextflow Ambassador!        Firas Zemzem      24 July 2024     Community Post
     As a PhD student in bioinformatics, I aimed to build robust pipelines to analyze diverse datasets throughout my research. Initially, mastering Bash scripting was a time-consuming challenge, but this journey ultimately led me to become a Nextflow Ambassador, engaging actively with the expert Nextflow community.    Join us in welcoming the new Nextflow Ambassadors        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      10 July 2024     As the second semester of 2024 kicks off, I am thrilled to welcome a new cohort of ambassadors to the Nextflow Ambassador Program. This vibrant group joins the dedicated ambassadors who are continuing their remarkable work from the previous semester. Together, they form a diverse and talented team, representing a variety of countries and backgrounds, encompassing both industry and academia.    Reflecting on a Six-Month Collaboration: Insights from a Nextflow Ambassador        Cristina Tuñi i Domínguez      19 June 2024     Community Post
     As a Nextflow Ambassador and a PhD student working in bioinformatics, I’ve always believed in the power of collaboration. Over the past six months, I’ve had the privilege of working with another PhD student specializing in metagenomics environmental science. This collaboration began through a simple email after the other researcher discovered my contact information on the ambassadors’ list page. It has been a journey of learning, problem-solving, and mutual growth. I’d like to share some reflections on this experience, highlighting both the challenges and the rewards.    Fostering Bioinformatics Growth in Türkiye        Kübra Narcı      12 June 2024     Community Post
     After diving into the Nextflow community, I’ve seen how it benefits bioinformatics in places like South Africa, Brazil, and France. I’m confident it can do the same for Türkiye by fostering collaboration and speeding up research. Since I became a Nextflow Ambassador, I am happy and excited because I can contribute to this development! Even though our first attempt to organize an introductory Nextflow workshop was online, it was a fruitful collaboration with RSG-Türkiye that initiated our effort to promote more Nextflow in Türkiye. We are happy to announce that we will organize a hands-on workshop soon.    Nextflow 24.04 - Release highlights          Paolo Di Tommaso  and Ben Sherman  and Phil Ewels    27 May 2024     We release an “edge” version of Nextflow every month and a “stable” version every six months. The stable releases are recommended for production usage and represent a significant milestone. The release changelogs contain a lot of detail, so we thought we’d highlight some of the goodies that have just been released in Nextflow 24.04 stable. Let’s get into it!    Open call for new Nextflow Ambassadors closes June 14        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      17 May 2024     Nextflow Ambassadors are passionate individuals within the Nextflow community who play a more active role in fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing, and engagement. We launched this program at the Nextflow Summit in Barcelona last year, and it’s been a great experience so far, so we’ve been recruiting more volunteers to expand the program. We’re going to close applications in June with the goal of having new ambassadors start in July, so if you’re interested in becoming an ambassador, now is your chance to apply!    Nextflow Training: Bridging Online Learning with In-Person Connections         Florian Wuennemann  and Kübra Narcı     8 May 2024     Community Post
     Nextflow and nf-core provide frequent community training events to new users, which offer an opportunity to get started using and understanding Nextflow, Groovy and nf-core. These events are live-streamed and are available for on-demand viewing on YouTube, but what if you could join friends in person and watch it live?    nf-schema: the new and improved nf-validation        Nicolas Vannieuwkerke      1 May 2024     Community Post
     Check out Nextflow’s newest plugin, nf-schema! It’s an enhanced version of nf-validation, utilizing JSON schemas to validate parameters and sample sheets. Unlike its predecessor, it supports the latest JSON schema draft and can convert pipeline-generated files. But what’s the story behind its development?    Empowering Bioinformatics: Mentoring Across Continents with Nextflow        Robert Petit      25 April 2024     Community Post
     In my journey with the nf-core Mentorship Program, I’ve mentored individuals from Malawi, Chile, and Brazil, guiding them through Nextflow and nf-core. Despite the distances, my mentees successfully adapted their workflows, contributing to the open-source community. Witnessing the transformative impact of mentorship firsthand, I’m encouraged to continue participating in future mentorship efforts and urge others to join this rewarding experience. But how did it all start?    Application of Nextflow and nf-core to ancient environmental eDNA        James Fellows Yates      17 April 2024     Community Post
     Ancient environmental DNA (eDNA) is currently a hot topic in archaeological, ecological, and metagenomic research fields. Recent eDNA studies have shown that authentic ‘ancient’ DNA can be recovered from soil and sediments even as far back as 2 million years ago(1). However, as with most things metagenomics (the simultaneous analysis of the entire DNA content of a sample), there is a need to work at scale, processing the large datasets of many sequencing libraries to ‘fish’ out the tiny amounts of temporally degraded ancient DNA from amongst a huge swamp of contaminating modern biomolecules.    One-Year Reflections on Nextflow Mentorship        Anabella Trigila      10 April 2024     Community Post
     From December 2022 to March 2023, I was part of the second cohort of the Nextflow and nf-core mentorship program, which spanned four months and attracted participants globally. I could not have anticipated the extent to which my participation in this program and the associated learning experiences would positively change my professional growth.
The mentorship aims to foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, flexible learning, collaborative coding, and contributions to the nf-core community. It was funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and is guided by experienced mentors in the community.
In the upcoming paragraphs, I’ll be sharing more details about the program—its structure, the valuable learning experiences it brought, and the exciting opportunities it opened up for me.    Leveraging nf-test for enhanced quality control in nf-core         Carson Miller  and Sateesh Peri     3 April 2024     Community Post
     Reproducibility is an important attribute of all good science. This is especially true in the realm of bioinformatics, where software is hopefully being updated, and pipelines are ideally being maintained. Improvements and maintenance are great, but they also bring about an important question: Do bioinformatics tools and pipelines continue to run successfully and produce consistent results despite these changes? Fortunately for us, there is an existing approach to ensure software reproducibility: testing.    Nextflow's colorful new console output        Phil Ewels      28 March 2024     Nextflow is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that runs in the terminal. Everyone who has launched Nextflow from the command line knows what it’s like to follow the console output as a pipeline runs: the excitement of watching jobs zipping off as they’re submitted, the satisfaction of the phrase “Pipeline completed successfully!” and occasionally, the sinking feeling of seeing an error message.    Nextflow workshop at the 20th KOGO Winter Symposium        Yuk Kei Wan      14 March 2024     Community Post
     Through a partnership between AWS Asia Pacific and Japan, and Seqera, Nextflow touched ground in South Korea for the first time with a training session at the Korea Genome Organization (KOGO) Winter Symposium. The objective was to introduce participants to Nextflow, empowering them to craft their own pipelines. Recognizing the interest among bioinformaticians, MinSung Cho from AWS Korea’s Healthcare & Research Team decided to sponsor this 90-minute workshop session. This initiative covered my travel expenses and accommodations.    Optimizing Nextflow for HPC and Cloud at Scale        Ben Sherman      17 January 2024     A Nextflow workflow run consists of the head job (Nextflow itself) and compute tasks (defined in the pipeline script). It is common to request resources for the tasks via process directives such as cpus and memory, but the Nextflow head job also requires compute resources. Most of the time, users don’t need to explicitly define the head job resources, as Nextflow generally does a good job of allocating resources for itself. For very large workloads, however, head job resource sizing becomes much more important.    Nextflow and nf-core Mentorship, Round 3        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      13 November 2023     With the third round of the Nextflow and nf-core mentorship program now behind us, it’s time to pop the confetti and celebrate the outstanding achievements of our latest group of mentors and mentees!    Nextflow Summit 2023 Recap        Noel Ortiz      25 October 2023     On Friday, Oct 20, we wrapped up our hackathon and Nextflow Summit in Barcelona, Spain. By any measure, this year’s Summit was our best community event ever, drawing roughly 900 attendees across multiple channels, including in-person attendees, participants in our #summit-2023 Slack channel, and Summit Livestream viewers on YouTube.    Introducing community.seqera.io        Phil Ewels      18 October 2023     We are very excited to introduce the Seqera community forum - the new home of the Nextflow community!    Introducing the Nextflow Ambassador Program        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      18 October 2023     We are excited to announce the launch of the Nextflow Ambassador Program, a worldwide initiative designed to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and community growth. It is intended to recognize and support the efforts of our community leaders and marks another step forward in our mission to advance scientific research and empower researchers.    Geraldine Van der Auwera joins Seqera        Geraldine Van der Auwera      11 October 2023     I’m excited to announce that I’m joining Seqera as Lead Developer Advocate. My mission is to support the growth of the Nextflow user community, especially in the USA, which will involve running community events, conducting training sessions, managing communications and working globally with our partners across the field to ensure Nextflow users have what they need to be successful. I’ll be working remotely from Boston, in collaboration with Paolo, Phil and the rest of the Nextflow team.    Nextflow goes to university!        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      24 July 2023     The Nextflow project originated from within an academic research group, so perhaps it’s no surprise that education is an essential part of the Nextflow and nf-core communities. Over the years, we have established several regular training resources: we have a weekly online seminar series called nf-core/bytesize and run hugely popular bi-annual Nextflow and nf-core community training online. In 2022, Seqera established a new community and growth team, funded in part by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative “Essential Open Source Software for Science” grant. We are all former bioinformatics researchers from academia and part of our mission is to build resources and programs to support academic institutions. We want to help to provide leading edge, high-quality, Nextflow and nf-core training for Masters and Ph.D. students in Bioinformatics and other related fields.    A Nextflow-Docker Murder Mystery: The mysterious case of the “OOM killer”        Graham Wright      19 June 2023     Most support tickets crossing our desks don’t warrant a blog article. However, occasionally we encounter a genuine mystery—a bug so pervasive and vile that it threatens innocent containers and pipelines everywhere. Such was the case of the OOM killer.    Reflecting on ten years of Nextflow awesomeness        Noel Ortiz      6 June 2023     There’s been a lot of water under the bridge since the first release of Nextflow in July 2013. From its humble beginnings at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona, Nextflow has evolved from an upstart workflow orchestrator to one of the most consequential projects in open science software (OSS). Today, Nextflow is downloaded 120,000+ times monthly, boasts vibrant user and developer communities, and is used by leading pharmaceutical, healthcare, and biotech research firms.    Nextflow on BIG IRON: Twelve tips for improving the effectiveness of pipelines on HPC clusters        Gordon Sissons      26 May 2023     With all the focus on cloud computing, it’s easy to forget that most Nextflow pipelines still run on traditional HPC clusters. In fact, according to our latest State of the Workflow 2023 community survey, 62.8% of survey respondents report running Nextflow on HPC clusters, and 75% use an HPC workload manager.<sup>1</sup> While the cloud is making gains, traditional clusters aren’t going away anytime soon.    Selecting the right storage architecture for your Nextflow pipelines        Paolo Di Tommaso      4 May 2023     In this article we present the various storage solutions supported by Nextflow including on-prem and cloud file systems, parallel file systems, and cloud object stores. We also discuss Fusion file system 2.0, a new high-performance file system that can help simplify configuration, improve throughput, and reduce costs in the cloud.    Celebrating our largest international training event and hackathon to date        Phil Ewels      25 April 2023     In mid-March, we conducted our bi-annual Nextflow and nf-core training and hackathon in what was unquestionably our best-attended community events to date. This year we had an impressive 1,345 participants attend the training from 76 countries. Attendees came from far and wide — from Algeria to Andorra to Zambia to Zimbabwe!    Nextflow and nf-core Mentorship, Round 2        Chris Hakkaart      17 April 2023     The global Nextflow and nf-core community is thriving with strong engagement in several countries. As we continue to expand and grow, we remain committed to prioritizing inclusivity and actively reaching groups with low representation.    The State of Kubernetes in Nextflow        Ben Sherman      10 March 2023     Hi, my name is Ben, and I’m a software engineer at Seqera Labs. I joined Seqera in November 2021 after finishing my Ph.D. at Clemson University. I work on a number of things at Seqera, but my primary role is that of a Nextflow core contributor.    Learn Nextflow in 2023        Evan Floden      24 February 2023     In 2023, the world of Nextflow is more exciting than ever! With new resources constantly being released, there is no better time to dive into this powerful tool. From a new Software Carpentries’ course to recordings of mutiple nf-core training events to new tutorials on Wave and Fusion, the options for learning Nextflow are endless.    Get started with Nextflow on Google Cloud Batch        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      1 February 2023     We have talked about Google Cloud Batch before. Not only that, we were proud to announce Nextflow support to Google Cloud Batch right after it was publicly released, back in July 2022. How amazing is that? But we didn’t stop there! The Nextflow official documentation also provides a lot of useful information on how to use Google Cloud Batch as the compute environment for your Nextflow pipelines. Having said that, feedback from the community is valuable, and we agreed that in addition to the documentation, teaching by example, and in a more informal language, can help many of our users. So, here is a tutorial on how to use the Batch service of the Google Cloud Platform with Nextflow 🥳    Analyzing caching behavior of pipelines        Abhinav Sharma      10 November 2022     The ability to resume an analysis (i.e. caching) is one of the core strengths of Nextflow. When developing pipelines, this allows us to avoid re-running unchanged processes by simply appending -resume to the nextflow run command. Sometimes, tasks may be repeated for reasons that are unclear. In these cases it can help to look into the caching mechanism, to understand why a specific process was re-run.    Nextflow Summit 2022 Recap        Noel Ortiz      3 November 2022     After a three-year COVID-related hiatus from in-person events, Nextflow developers and users found their way to Barcelona this October for the 2022 Nextflow Summit. Held at Barcelona’s iconic Agbar tower, this was easily the most successful Nextflow community event yet!    Rethinking containers for cloud native pipelines        Paolo Di Tommaso      13 October 2022     Containers have become an essential part of well-structured data analysis pipelines. They encapsulate applications and dependencies in portable, self-contained packages that can be easily distributed. Containers are also key to enabling predictable and reproducible results.    Turbo-charging the Nextflow command line with Fig!        Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas      22 September 2022     Nextflow is a powerful workflow manager that supports multiple container technologies, cloud providers and HPC job schedulers. It shouldn’t be a surprise that wide ranging functionality leads to a complex interface, but comes with the drawback of many subcommands and options to remember. For a first-time user (and sometimes even for some long-time users) it can be difficult to remember everything. This is not a new problem for the command-line; even very common applications such as grep and tar are famous for having a bewildering array of options.    Nextflow and nf-core mentorship, Round 1        Chris Hakkaart      18 September 2022     Our recent The State of the Workflow 2022: Community Survey Results showed that Nextflow and nf-core have a strong global community with a high level of engagement in several countries. As the community continues to grow, we aim to prioritize inclusivity for everyone through active outreach to groups with low representation.    Deploy Nextflow Pipelines with Google Cloud Batch!        Paolo Di Tommaso      13 July 2022     A key feature of Nextflow is the ability to abstract the implementation of data analysis pipelines so they can be deployed in a portable manner across execution platforms.    Nextflow Summit 2022        Phil Ewels      17 June 2022     As recently announced, we are super excited to host a new Nextflow community event late this year! The Nextflow Summit will take place October 12-14, 2022 at the iconic Torre Glòries in Barcelona, with an associated nf-core hackathon beforehand.    Evolution of the Nextflow runtime        Paolo Di Tommaso      24 March 2022     Software development is a constantly evolving process that requires continuous adaptation to keep pace with new technologies, user needs, and trends. Likewise, changes are needed in order to introduce new capabilities and guarantee a sustainable development process.    Nextflow’s community is moving to Slack!        Paolo Di Tommaso      22 February 2022     The Nextflow community channel on Gitter has grown substantially over the last few years and today has more than 1,300 members.    Learning Nextflow in 2022        Evan Floden      21 January 2022     A lot has happened since we last wrote about how best to learn Nextflow, over a year ago. Several new resources have been released including a new Nextflow Software Carpentries course and an excellent write-up by 23andMe.    Configure Git private repositories with Nextflow        Abhinav Sharma      21 October 2021     Git has become the de-facto standard for source-code version control system and has seen increasing adoption across the spectrum of software development.    Setting up a Nextflow environment on Windows 10        Evan Floden      13 October 2021     For Windows users, getting access to a Linux-based Nextflow development and runtime environment used to be hard. Users would need to run virtual machines, access separate physical servers or cloud instances, or install packages such as Cygwin or Wubi. Fortunately, there is now an easier way to deploy a complete Nextflow development environment on Windows.    Introducing Nextflow support for SQL databases        Paolo Di Tommaso      16 September 2021     The recent tweet introducing the Nextflow support for SQL databases raised a lot of positive reaction. In this post, I want to describe more in detail how this extension works.    Five more tips for Nextflow user on HPC        Kevin Sayers      15 June 2021     In May we blogged about Five Nextflow Tips for HPC Users and now we continue the series with five additional tips for deploying Nextflow with on HPC batch schedulers.    5 Nextflow Tips for HPC Users        Kevin Sayers      13 May 2021     Nextflow is a powerful tool for developing scientific workflows for use on HPC systems. It provides a simple solution to deploy parallelized workloads at scale using an elegant reactive/functional programming model in a portable manner.    6 Tips for Setting Up Your Nextflow Dev Environment        Evan Floden      4 March 2021     This blog follows up the Learning Nextflow in 2020 blog post.    Introducing Nextflow for Azure Batch        Paolo Di Tommaso      22 February 2021     When the Nextflow project was created, one of the main drivers was to enable reproducible data pipelines that could be deployed across a wide range of execution platforms with minimal effort as well as to empower users to scale their data analysis while facilitating the migration to the cloud.    Learning Nextflow in 2020        Evan Floden & Alain Coletta      1 December 2020     With the year nearly over, we thought it was about time to pull together the best-of-the-best guide for learning Nextflow in 2020. These resources will support anyone in the journey from total noob to Nextflow expert so this holiday season, give yourself or someone you know the gift of learning Nextflow!

The Nextflow CLI - tricks and treats!        Abhinav Sharma      22 October 2020     For most developers, the command line is synonymous with agility. While tools such as Nextflow Tower are opening up the ecosystem to a whole new set of users, the Nextflow CLI remains a bedrock for pipeline development. The CLI in Nextflow has been the core interface since the beginning; however, its full functionality was never extensively documented. Today we are excited to release the first iteration of the CLI documentation available on the Nextflow website.    Nextflow DSL 2 is here!        Paolo Di Tommaso      24 July 2020     We are thrilled to announce the stable release of Nextflow DSL 2 as part of the latest 20.07.1 version!

over the Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS).    Nexflow Hackathon 2017        Evan Floden      30 September 2017     Last week saw the inaugural Nextflow meeting organised at the Centre for Genomic Regulation
(CRG) in Barcelona. The event combined talks, demos, a tutorial/workshop for beginners as
well as two hackathon sessions for more advanced users.    Nextflow and the Common Workflow Language        Kevin Sayers      20 July 2017     The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a specification for defining
workflows in a declarative manner. It has been implemented to varying degrees
by different software packages. Nextflow and CWL share a common goal of enabling portable
reproducible workflows.    Nextflow workshop is coming!        Paolo Di Tommaso      26 April 2017     We are excited to announce the first Nextflow workshop that will take place at the
Barcelona Biomedical Research Park building (PRBB) on 14-15th September 2017.    Nextflow published in Nature Biotechnology        Paolo Di Tommaso      12 April 2017     We are excited to announce the publication of our work Nextflow enables reproducible computational workflows in Nature Biotechnology.    More fun with containers in HPC        Paolo Di Tommaso      20 December 2016     Nextflow was one of the first workflow framework
to provide built-in support for Docker containers. A couple of years ago we also started
to experiment with the deployment of containerised bioinformatic pipelines at CRG,
using Docker technology (see here and here).    Enabling elastic computing with Nextflow        Paolo Di Tommaso      19 October 2016     In the previous post I introduced
the new cloud native support for AWS provided by Nextflow.    Deploy your computational pipelines in the cloud at the snap-of-a-finger        Paolo Di Tommaso      1 September 2016     Nextflow is a framework that simplifies the writing of parallel and distributed computational
pipelines in a portable and reproducible manner across different computing platforms, from
a laptop to a cluster of computers.    Docker for dunces & Nextflow for nunces        Evan Floden      10 June 2016     Below is a step-by-step guide for creating Docker images for use with Nextflow pipelines. This post was inspired by recent experiences and written with the hope that it may encourage others to join in the virtualization revolution.    Workflows & publishing: best practice for reproducibility        Evan Floden      13 April 2016     Publication time acts as a snapshot for scientific work. Whether a project is ongoing
or not, work which was performed months ago must be described, new software documented,
data collated and figures generated.    Error recovery and automatic resource management with Nextflow        Paolo Di Tommaso      11 February 2016     Recently a new feature has been added to Nextflow that allows failing jobs to be rescheduled,
automatically increasing the amount of computational resources requested.    Developing a bioinformatics pipeline across multiple environments        Evan Floden      4 February 2016     As a new bioinformatics student with little formal computer science training, there are
few things that scare me more than PhD committee meetings and having to run my code in a
completely different operating environment.    MPI-like distributed execution with Nextflow        Paolo Di Tommaso      13 November 2015     The main goal of Nextflow is to make workflows portable across different
computing platforms taking advantage of the parallelisation features provided
by the underlying system without having to reimplement your application code.    The impact of Docker containers on the performance of genomic pipelines        Paolo Di Tommaso      15 June 2015     In a recent publication we assessed the impact of Docker containers technology
on the performance of bioinformatic tools and data analysis workflows.    Innovation In Science - The story behind Nextflow        Maria Chatzou      9 June 2015     Innovation can be viewed as the application of solutions that meet new requirements or
existing market needs. Academia has traditionally been the driving force of innovation.
Scientific ideas have shaped the world, but only a few of them were brought to market by
the inventing scientists themselves, resulting in both time and financial loses.    Introducing Nextflow REPL Console        Paolo Di Tommaso      14 April 2015     The latest version of Nextflow introduces a new console graphical interface.    Using Docker for scientific data analysis in an HPC cluster        Paolo Di Tommaso      6 November 2014     Scientific data analysis pipelines are rarely composed by a single piece of software.
In a real world scenario, computational pipelines are made up of multiple stages, each of which
can execute many different scripts, system commands and external tools deployed in a hosting computing
environment, usually an HPC cluster.    Reproducibility in Science - Nextflow meets Docker        Maria Chatzou      9 September 2014     The scientific world nowadays operates on the basis of published articles.
These are used to report novel discoveries to the rest of the scientific community.    Share Nextflow pipelines with GitHub        Paolo Di Tommaso      7 August 2014     The GitHub code repository and collaboration platform is widely
used between researchers to publish their work and to collaborate on projects source code.       Stay Tuned Social Links        Subscribe to our blog RSS Feed.        Subscribe to our Twitter Feed.
