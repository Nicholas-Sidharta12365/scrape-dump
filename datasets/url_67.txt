Conditional process resources
Problem
A task in your workflow needs to use some amount of computing 
resources (e.g. memory) that depends on the size or the name of one 
or more input files. 
Solution
Declare the resource requirements (memory, cpus, etc.)
in a dynamic manner using a closure. 
The closure computes the required amount of resources using the file 
attributes (e.g. size) of the inputs declared in the process
definition.
Code
process foo {
    memory { reads.size() < 70.KB ? 1.GB : 5.GB }

    input:
    path reads

    """
    echo your_command_here --in ${reads} --mem=${task.memory.giga}
    """
}

workflow {
    Channel.fromPath("$baseDir/data/reads/*_1.fq.gz", checkIfExists:true) \
        | foo
}
