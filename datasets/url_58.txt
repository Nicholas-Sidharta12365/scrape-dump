Process all outputs altogether
Problem
You need to process all the outputs of an upstream task altogether. 
Solution
Use the collect operator to gather 
all the outputs produced by the upstream task and emit them as a single output. 
Then use the resulting channel as input for the downstream task.
Code
process foo {
  input:
  path x
  output:
  path 'file.fq'
  script:
  """
  < $x zcat > file.fq
  """
}

process bar {
  debug true   
  input:
  path '*.fq'
  script:
  """
  cat *.fq | head -n 50
  """
}

workflow {
  Channel.fromPath("$baseDir/data/reads/*_1.fq.gz", checkIfExists: true) \
    | foo \
    | collect \
    | bar
}

Run it
Use the the following command to execute the example:
nextflow run nextflow-io/patterns/process-collect.nf
